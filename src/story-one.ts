        text:
          "One of Australia's most prominent poets, Judith Wright coined a modern language with a changing style and voice, highlighting her concerns throughout her career. Defender of aboriginal rights and activist in the conservation of the national natural heritage, she was part of the movements that generated tangible changes in the conception of a society; she is aware of the symbolic value of the territory of those who came before and diaphanous with respect to her complicated colonial heritage. <br/><br/> Between the 1940s and 50s, she achieved national recognition with the publication of her second book of poems, critics and symbolics that claimed the responsibility of her ancestors for the crimes of the past - of which ‘Niggers Leap, New England’ stands out. In her verses she narrates the undocumented history of Darkie Point, where 'the white settlers of that region had led the ab endeavines on their cliffs in retaliation for having shot an arrow at their cattle'. <br/><br/> Hailing from a family of top landowners in the Hunter Valley (New England) and Queensland, Judith finds in her grandfather's diaries the essence of her colonial legacy and the source of a horrified guilt that will haunt her to the end of her life. The records taken between 1830 and 1880 reflect the struggle to dominate the landscape with all its trauma and pain, but above all, they will be the stories of the interaction with the native peoples that will modify the way in which the poet interprets her own history and the of your nation. <br/><br/> In 1967 he published the historical novel The Generations of Men based on the records of his grandfather, a tribute to his ancestors that at the same time included the lack of conscience and political judgment of past generations. This inflection between the new and the old gradually leads her to a critical conscience, permeating in her verses a growing desire to rewrite pastoral migration as a colonial invasion.",
